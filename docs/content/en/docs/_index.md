Welcome to the documentation for GoLC, an innovative project for building Go applications with Large Language Models (LLMs) through composability. Inspired by the LangChain project, GoLC provides a framework that enables developers to seamlessly integrate LLM-based applications. By leveraging the concept of composability, GoLC allows for the modular construction of LLM-based components, offering flexibility and extensibility to develop powerful language processing applications in Go.

Please refer to the following sections for detailed usage instructions and examples.
