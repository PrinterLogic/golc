Prompt templates serve as predefined recipes for generating prompts tailored for language models within the GoLC project. These templates encompass instructions, few-shot examples, and contextual questions, specifically designed for various tasks. GoLC offers dedicated tools for crafting and utilizing prompt templates. The project emphasizes model-agnostic templates, fostering their seamless reuse across diverse language models. Conventionally, language models anticipate prompts in the form of either a string or a list of chat messages.
