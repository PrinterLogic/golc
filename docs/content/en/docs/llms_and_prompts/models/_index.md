Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation. They are trained on extensive text data, capable of tasks like text generation, question answering, and translation.

These models differ in their focuses, with some excelling in creative content generation, while others specialize in conversational AI and chatbot applications. The flexibility offered by GoLC allows developers to choose models that best suit their specific needs, whether it's dynamic conversation, content creation, or other language-related tasks.
