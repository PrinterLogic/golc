Prompts and Large Language Models (LLMs) are integral aspects of language processing, each playing a unique role in the development of intelligent applications.

- Prompts: GoLC simplifies the management and optimization of prompts, providing a generic interface that facilitates seamless interaction with LLMs. This simplification enhances the integration of prompts into applications, offering developers a straightforward approach to harnessing the power of language models.

- LLMs (Large Language Models): GoLC provides a standardized interface for working with LLMs, allowing developers to easily incorporate these powerful models into their applications. This empowers applications with advanced language processing capabilities, opening doors to tasks like text generation, summarization, and more.
