Retrievers play a crucial role in the field of natural language processing by enabling the retrieval of relevant information from large datasets. They act as the bridge between the input query and the data source, facilitating the extraction of pertinent data to support various language processing tasks. Retrievers are particularly useful in tasks such as question-answering, information retrieval, and knowledge graph construction.

GoLC provides support for pre-designed retrievers, including popular services such as Amazon Kendra, Azure Cognitive Search, and Vector Store retrievers.
